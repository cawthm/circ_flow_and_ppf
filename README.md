# Economics: Circular Flow & Production Possibilities Frontier

An interactive educational website designed to introduce fundamental economic concepts to students.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. The Circular Flow Diagram

The circular flow model illustrates how the economy functions as a continuous cycle of exchanges between two main groups:

**Firms**
- Produce goods and services
- Use factors of production (labor, land, capital) as inputs
- Sell in goods markets, buy in factor markets

**Households**
- Own factors of production
- Consume goods and services
- Sell factors to earn income, spend income on goods

**Two Types of Markets**
- **Goods and Services Market:** Where firms sell and households buy products
- **Factor Market:** Where households sell and firms buy labor, land, and capital

**Two Types of Flows**
- **Real flows (green):** Physical movement of goods, services, and factors
- **Money flows (red):** Payments for goods, services, and factors

### 2. Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

The PPF shows the trade-offs an economy faces when allocating limited resources between two goods (wine and cheese in our example).

**Key Concepts**
- **Efficient points:** On the curve - all resources are being used optimally
- **Inefficient points:** Inside the curve - resources are underutilized or misallocated
- **Unattainable points:** Outside the curve - not achievable with current resources and technology
- **Opportunity cost:** The slope of the PPF represents what must be given up to produce more of one good
